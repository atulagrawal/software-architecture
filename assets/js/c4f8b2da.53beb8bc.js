We all understand the need for having the unit test cases but then we have questions about the measurement criteria. E.g. is it important to have well written test cases vs some poorly written test cases that have 90% line coverage?\\n\\nThis is where we need to share a big picture with the team mates and we need to explain why part (goasl and objectives) so that they helps in achieveing the actual goal even though if it means that we have to adjust the measurement criteria from 85% coverage to 80% coverage but well written and maintained test cases.\\n\\n> The maintainance of the test case is very important and as and we should add update them if we are founding any new bug.\\n\\n\\nThe big picture can be shared in the following format:\\nGoal :\\n- Our goal of the platform is to improve time to market.\\nObjective #1 :\\n- **Improve developer\'s efficiency by having well written unit test cases that helps in catching bugs during development phase itself instead of catching them during integration testing or in live.**\\nOutcome:\\n- Unit test coverage is required to be 85% to ensure that all critical path of the codes are covered.\\n- No of issues detected post development due to code changes.\\n- So on...\\nProcess :\\n- Ensure that test cases are well-written and covers critical business use cases during reviews.\\n- Ensure that test cases are being updated if a new bug is identified.\\n- \\n\\nObjective #2 :\\n- Improve the modulatiry of the code so that developers are able to easily understand the codebase and know the scope of the code change and its impact.\\n- So on..."},{"id":"transactions-across-the-data-centers","metadata":{"permalink":"/software-architecture/blog/transactions-across-the-data-centers","editUrl":"https://github.com/atulagrawal/software-architecture/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/transactions-across-the-data-centers.md","source":"@site/blog/transactions-across-the-data-centers.md","title":"Transactions across the data centers","description":"","date":"2023-05-30T12:30:03.000Z","formattedDate":"May 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Database","permalink":"/software-architecture/blog/tags/database"},{"label":"Multi Data Center","permalink":"/software-architecture/blog/tags/multi-data-center"}],"readingTime":0.08,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Google Developers","title":"Transactions across the datacenters","image_url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/fca_HuJ99xUxflWdex0XViC3NfctBFreIl8y4i9z411asnGTWY-Ql3MeH_ybA4kNaOjY7kyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","imageURL":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/fca_HuJ99xUxflWdex0XViC3NfctBFreIl8y4i9z411asnGTWY-Ql3MeH_ybA4kNaOjY7kyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"transactions-across-the-data-centers","title":"Transactions across the data centers","authors":{"name":"Google Developers","title":"Transactions across the datacenters","image_url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/fca_HuJ99xUxflWdex0XViC3NfctBFreIl8y4i9z411asnGTWY-Ql3MeH_ybA4kNaOjY7kyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","imageURL":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/fca_HuJ99xUxflWdex0XViC3NfctBFreIl8y4i9z411asnGTWY-Ql3MeH_ybA4kNaOjY7kyA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"},"tags":["Database","Multi Data Center"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Goals, Objective and Outcomes","permalink":"/software-architecture/blog/goals-objectives-and-outcomes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Choosing the Best Database in a System Design Interview","permalink":"/software-architecture/blog/choosing-the-best-database-in-a-system-design-interview"}},"content":"<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/srOgpXECblk\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer;
